## Part 1 (Basic Implementation)
### To run the simulation. <br>
In the top most directory, change directory to part1/stratus/. 
```bash 
$ cd part1/stratus/
```
Then use the following commands to run the corresponding simulation.
#### Behavior Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_B1
```
#### Verilog BASIC Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_V_BASIC1
```
#### Verilog DPA Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_V_DPA1
```
Output image is under part1/stratus/ folder.
<br>

## Part 2 (Coding style improvement)
### To run the simulation. <br>
In the top most directory, change directory to part2/stratus/. 
```bash 
$ cd part2/stratus/
```
Then use the following commands to run the corresponding simulation.
#### Behavior Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_B1
```
#### Verilog BASIC Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_V_BASIC1
```
#### Verilog DPA Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_V_DPA1
```
Output image is under part2/stratus/ folder.
<br>

## Part 3 (Optimized implementation)
### To run the simulation. <br>
In the top most directory, change directory to part3/stratus/. 
```bash 
$ cd part3/stratus/
```
Then use the following commands to run the corresponding simulation.
#### Behavior Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_B1
```
#### Verilog BASIC Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_V_BASIC1
```
#### Verilog DPA Simulation
```bash 
$ make sim_V_DPA1
```
Output image is under part3/stratus/ folder.
